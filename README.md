# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This time table sets a daily schedule throughout a work day (08 AM to 05 PM). Users can input text as tasks within a time slot, save those tasks for later, and check whether the task is in the past, present, or future.

The JavaScript uses DOM traversal, objects, attributes, appends, event listeners, local storage, and third-party APIs such as jQuery and Day.js to create and store time tables.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open the website (<>), type in any desired text inside of a schedule row, and click on the 'Save' button on the row's right to store a text for later use. The text can be overwritten by editing and/or deleting existing text, then pressing the adjacent 'Save' button.

The background color of the time slots change based on whether they're in the past, present or future. Furthermore, a live date and clock are on the top of the page to cross-reference the schedule.
